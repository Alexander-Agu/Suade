          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>The SS1 shirt symbolizes a start of something big and beautiful. 
            The spider on the SS1 t-shirt is a reminder to us that everything in life is cyclical
             and the idea of beginnings and endings can sometimes be blurred. The spider can 
             represent our own life cycle. Everything connects back to the beginning, and there is
              no endingâ€”only when the spider decides it is done. Spiders weave a web, [and] just like
               our lives may symbolize a web, because we are always growing.
            The spider symbolizes resilience, curiosity, wonder, growth and creativity in the weaving of fate, [and] spider teaches you to maintain balance. It can be between past and future, physical, and spiritual.
            Last but not least, spiders represent the idea that everything is connected. "Spiders can symbolize all interconnected in something bigger than ourselves, made by their web," adding, "People think of being 'caught in a web,' but I see it as meaning that sometimes we get caught up in feelings and people that do not serve us, which helps us grow."
